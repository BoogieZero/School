		<h1>Luck</h1>
		<article>
			<p>
			The definition of luck (or chance) varies by the philosophical, religious, mystical, and emotional context of the one interpreting it; according to the classic Noah Webster's dictionary, luck is "a purposeless, unpredictable and uncontrollable force that shapes events favourably or unfavourably for an individual, group or cause".[1] Yet the author Max Gunther defines it as "events that influence one's life and are seemingly beyond one's control".[2]
		</p>
		<p>
			When thought of as a factor beyond one's control, without regard to one's will, intention, or desired result, there are at least two senses that people usually mean when they use the term, the prescriptive sense and the descriptive sense. In the prescriptive sense, luck is a supernatural and deterministic concept that there are forces (e.g. gods or spirits) that prescribe that certain events occur very much the way laws of physics will prescribe that certain events occur. It is the prescriptive sense that people mean when they say they "do not believe in luck". In the descriptive sense, people speak of luck after events that they find to be fortunate or unfortunate, and maybe improbable.

			Therefore, cultural views of luck vary from perceiving luck as a matter of random chance to attributing to such explanations of faith or superstition. For example, the Romans believed in the embodiment of luck as the goddess Fortuna,[3] whereas the philosopher Daniel Dennett believes that "luck is mere luck" rather than a property of a person or thing.[4] Carl Jung viewed luck as synchronicity, which he described as "a meaningful coincidence".

			<h2>Social aspects</h2>
			Luck is an important factor in many aspects of society.
			<h3>Games</h3>
			<p>
				A game may depend on luck rather than skill or effort. For example, chess does not involve any random factors such as throwing dice, while dominoes has the "luck of the draw" when selecting tiles. In poker, especially games with a communal board, pure luck may decide a winning hand. Luck in games involving chance is defined as the change in a player's equity after a random event such as a die roll or card draw.[13] Luck is positive (good luck) if the player's position is improved and negative (bad luck) if it is worsened. A poker player who is doing well (playing successfully, winning) is said to be "running good".[14] There is, currently, no academic research as to explain how some profitable players who ascribe their profitability to a mix of probability and chance understand luck in the game.
